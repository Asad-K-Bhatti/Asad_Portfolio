            <p><b>Our objective is to create functioning house using buttons to control internal lighting and a security 
                system composed of a sensor and a buzzer.</b></p>

            <h2>Basic Wiring</h2>
            <p class="text">As the project required the use of multiple LEDs and electronic devices, a basic understanding of how some of these devices need to be wired would be beneficial.</p>

                        <p>By repeating the circuit layout for a single LED (as shown previously), we could repeat that design 4 times to light up 4 rooms in the house with every 
                            light attached to a button which would act as a light switch.</p>
                        <p>Alongside the lighting we needed to wire the security system which composed of a ultrasonic sensor to detect anyone coming into the house and a 
                            buzzer to sound when a person is detected by the ultrasonic sensor.</p>
