            <h2>Project Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Design a mechanism that aids a client, affected by <b>Generalized dystonia</b>, with her fine motor skills directed towards <b>writing,
                drawing, and painting.</b></p>
            <p>As a result of this condition, the client experiences <b>shaking and pain in their right hand and wrist</b> when writing
                or typing for prolonged time periods.</p>
            <p>This system will be <b>accurate, durable and comfortable</b> enough to be used in <b>any location.</b></p>
            <br>
            <h2>Project Objective and Constraints</h2>
            <p><b>The overarching function of our design was to allow the client to write, draw, and paint
                comfortably and accurately in any location.</b></p> 
            <br>
            <p>The resulting <b>primary objectives</b> of this device
                were for it be portable and accurate. </p>
            <ul>
                <p>The <b>portability</b> sub-objective included, making the
                    device lightweight and small.</p>
                <p>The <b>accuracy</b> sub-objective, included ensuring that
                    it was sturdy, comfortable, and adjustable. </p>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Some <b>constraints</b> to the design were:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>The mechanism could <b>not be too light</b> due to the effects that the clientâ€™s dystonia has on the
                    stability of her hands.</p>
                <p>The mechanism must be <b>resistant to liquid</b> due to allow the client to paint, and use the product in wet conditions 
                    without cauing any damage to its structure.</p>
                <p>Due to the limited budget, the design must <b>cost less than fifty dollars</b> to construct.</p>
            </ul>
