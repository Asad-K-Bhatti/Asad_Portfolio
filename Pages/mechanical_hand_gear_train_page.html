            <h2>About the Mechanism</h2>
            <p>This Mechanism is intended to be a <b>functional prosthetic hand</b> that focuses on the motion of the <b>thumb and forefinger.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>The <b>movement</b> of the thumb and forefinger is to be enabled through a <b>gear train</b> of multiple gears meshing together and connected to a <b>motor.</b></p>
            <p>The motor will provide rotational motion, which will be transferred to the finger and thumb through the gears.</p>
            <p>The goal of this prosthetic hand is to convert an input speed of <b>936 RPM</b> from the motor into a resulting rotational speed of <b>20 RPM</b> at the fingers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are two major <b>constraints</b>:</p>
            <ul>
                <p><b>Size of chassis</b></p>
                <p>The chassis for the gear train as well as the gears must fit inside the given shell for the prosthetic hand.</p>

                width="100%">
                <p><b>Gear Limitation</b></p>
                <p>The size of all the gears can not be less than 12 teeth and the gear ratio between two meshed gears cannot exceed 5 or be less than 1/5.</p>
            </ul>

                        <h1>Design 2</h1>
                        <p>This gear train takes advantage of using the spur gears along a horizontal plane which would provide more room to expand the middle gear and therefore reduce the RPM 
                            from the motor to the fingers by a large margin.</p>
                        <p>The primary concern for this design was how to accomodate and calculate the speed as a result of the worm gears and whether the horizontal spur gears 
                            would interfere with any of the vertical spur gears.</p>

            <p class="text">Following these designs, the consensus decided to create a design similar to Design 1 but remove the worm gears as they can easily be replaced by an axle and do 
                not affect the RPM in any manner</p>

            <p class="text">After the gear train design was decided and accurate calculations were performed the following table of design parameters was created.</p>

                        <h1>1. Cuts in Chassis</h1>
                        <p>As is seen above the chassis has been cut to accomodate for the hardware required to keep the gears in place (i.e. bolts to fasten the gear on the axle from either side).</p>
                        <p>As a result for not acommodating space for the bolts in the chassis design there was enough space for the gears but not enough space for the gears and the bolts. Resulting in the chassis 
                            being cut and significantly reducing the stability and structure of the chassis</p>
                        <p><b>Possible Solution:</b> Accomodate hardware space into design or build a chassis with excess space and then trim down to fit.</p>

                        <h1>2. Gears unable to spin axle connected gears</h1>
                        <p>It is not visible in the images above but the gears on the chassis were unable to spin the gears with axle connections. Meaning the gears that were meshed were able to spin and move each other but not spin the axle.</p>
                        <p>This maybe a result of excessive drilling for the center hole of the chassis or poor adhesion of the gear to the axle.</p>
                        <p><b>Possible Solution:</b> Use tiny amounts of glue to fasten the bolts to the gear firmly or if possible print the center of the gear to be a very snug fit on the axle such that minor adjustment is not needed.</p>
